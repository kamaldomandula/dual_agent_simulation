            ## Overview

            Welcome to the **Duel Agent Simulation** app! This Streamlit application allows you to chat with Meta's Llama3 model in a unique interview simulation. The app features two agents in an interview scenario, with a judge providing feedback. The best part? You simply provide a topic, and the simulation runs itself!
